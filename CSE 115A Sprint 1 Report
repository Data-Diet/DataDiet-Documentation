Actions to Stop Doing: 
 - The team should stop creating such large and vague user stories because they are difficult to break down into smaller detailed tasks, thus slowing progress down with overwhelming goals that one member must accomplish on their own.

Actions to Start Doing:
 - The team should improve on communication and task management since some members were initially not making progress towards the previous sprint, thus leading to user stories getting forced into the next sprint.

Actions to Keep Doing:
 - The team should continue to meet often to discuss any problems that the members are encountering and sort out any confusion.
