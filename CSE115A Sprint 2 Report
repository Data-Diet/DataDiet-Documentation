Sprint 2 Report | DataDiet | Peanuts Gang | November 3, 2019

Actions to Stop Doing: 
  - The team needs to stop inadequately allocating time to work on the project because they are getting preoccupied with other classes and neglecting their app tasks.
  - The team needs to stop underestimating the amount of time that is required to complete the user stories and their tasks, because they are unfamiliar with the codebase, so everything needs to be learned prior to implementation.

Actions to Start Doing:
  - The team needs to start creating smaller user stories that do not have as many associated tasks because these large user stories are taking a long time to finish and the scrum board/burnup chart make it seem like no progress is being made.
  - The team needs to start updating the online scrum board more frequently so everyone is aware of the progress being made, especially if one feature relies on the completion of another task.

Actions to Keep Doing:
  - The team should continue to meet often to discuss any problems that the members are encountering and sort out any confusion.
  - The team should continue to peer program together.
